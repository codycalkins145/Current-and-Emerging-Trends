# Current-and-Emerging-Trends
  Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    
    For this project, I created the Q-Training Algorithm needed for a pirate (intelligent agent) 
    to reach the treasure in a maze.  The code given to me for this scenario was the code needed
    for the agent to perform exploration based on predictions and memory (GameExperience.py),
    the code used to represent the game environment and calculate rewards (TreasureMaze.py),
    and all of the Jupyter Notebook excluding the main body of the Q-Training Algorithm.
  
  Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  
     * What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        Computer scientists develop and maintain compliant, secure, and user-friendly
        software based on business needs. Programs made in this way are needed to ensure
        that the company and the users are protected and that they perform in the way
        that they are needed and expected.
        
     * How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
        When I approach a problem, I ensure that I have all the information I need to
        achieve the desired goal.  If I am creating a new program, I ensure that I know where
        to look for needed information and understand what is needed for the project.
        On the other hand, if I am helping to update a program, I make sure to understand
        the original intentions of the program so that any changes made do not negatively
        impact or change the overall functionality.
        
     * What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? 
        My ethical responsibilites are to ensure that user data is protected and company
        security is maintained in order to protect this data.  More specifically, I must
        make sure that user data is handled correctly and used consensually and within 
        the confines of the law.
